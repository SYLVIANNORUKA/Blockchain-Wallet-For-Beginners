# Understanding Blockchain Wallets for Beginners

## 📖 Introduction

A **blockchain wallet** is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC. It works by securely storing your **private and public keys** while interacting with different blockchain networks.



## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **Public Key:**  
  An address you share with others to receive funds. Think of it like your account number.

- **Private Key:**  
  A secret code that gives you full control over your funds. It’s like your PIN or password — never share it with anyone.
